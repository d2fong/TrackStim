# TrackStim

This is a work in progrss version of TrackStim.

This program is a micro manager plugin that provides:
- automated tracking of moving c.elegans in real time
- xy stage velocity data for analysis

## Requirements
- Micro-Manager 1.3

## Building the plugin

In this repository is a file called TrackStim.java

You must use this command to take TrackStim.java and other packages that TrackStim.java depends on to build the plugin (macOSX specific):

```sh
javac -source 1.5 -target 1.5 -classpath /Applications/Micro-Manager1.4/ij.jar:/Applications/Micro-Manager1.4/plugins/Micro-Manager/MMCoreJ.jar:/Applications/Micro-Manager1.4/plugins/Micro-Manager/MMJ_.jar -Xlint:unchecked TrackStim.java

```

Then, run the following command:

```sh
jar cvf TrackStim_.jar TrackStim_03.class TrackingThread10.class Signalsender.class
```


Once the command finishes, you should see a file called ```TrackStim.jar```.  You need to take this jar file and copy it to ```/Applications/Micro-Manager1.3/mmplugins/```.

Once you start micromanager, you should be able to select TrackStim from the plugins menu.
